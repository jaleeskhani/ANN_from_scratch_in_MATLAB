# ANN_from_scratch_in_MATLAB
In this repository, I have provided a complete code of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implemented in MATLAB from scratch using doubly linked lists. I have implemented feed forward and back propagation algorithm. You simply need to download and run the main file. The experiments are performed using MNIST digits dataset.
